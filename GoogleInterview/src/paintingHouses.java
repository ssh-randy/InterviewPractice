We'll say there are "N" houses, where N is some integer. 
Each house can be painted in either Red, Green or Blue. 
The cost of coloring each house in each of the colors is different.

Figure out how to color each house so no two adjacent houses have the same color 
and the total cost of coloring all the houses is as low as possible.
